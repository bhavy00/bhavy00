### Hey Visitor ðŸ‘‹

I am delighted to introduce myself as a highly motivated MERN stack developer and final year engineering student at BIT Mesra. 

I have immersed myself in various programming challenges and honed my skills as a competitive programmer in C++. This experience has sharpened my problem-solving abilities and nurtured my understanding of data structures and algorithms.  

I have developed a deep expertise in MongoDB, Express.js, React.js, and Node.js. Through several projects, I have gained hands-on experience in building full-stack web applications and implementing efficient and scalable solutions. I am well-versed in utilizing object-oriented programming concepts to develop robust and maintainable code.
